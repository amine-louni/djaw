"Djaw" is a small Javascript  project that makes use of the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net)
service for fetching and displaying weather data and forecasts based on a given location (latitude & longtitude).

* Customizing bootstrap
* Defining a service for fetching weather data from openweathermap.com  using async/await and promises
* Defining a custom directive for instantly embedding sort of "weather data day panel"
* Build a progressive web application
